    <!-- bio -->
    <p>bio<br> Engaging and memorable with a unique instrumentation and tuneful compositions, Knisely is a Columbus, Ohio-based quartet performing original music for violin, clarinet, vibraphone and piano. Since forming in late 2019, Knisely initially performed via live streams and music videos as the pandemic hit Ohio in early 2020. Their genuine and inviting online performances created a dialogue between the performers and the audience, which has remained in their welcoming live performances. In fall of 2021, Knisely recently released their debut self-titled album, which is available to stream and download on all major platforms.</p>
