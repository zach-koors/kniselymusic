    <p>On Sunday 26 September 2021, we played a full concert at Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Dublin, OH. We had the honor of kicking off their '21-22 concert series, and we had a great time performing in such beautiful looking and sounding space! <a href="https://youtu.be/CHYfrNTRRtw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>You can watch the full concert on YouTube here.</u></a></p>

    <p>We played during Sunday morning worship services at Worthington United Methodist Church on 15 August 2021. We were so glad to share our music with the congregation there, and we couldn't have asked for better weather during the outdoor service! Maybe just a little less wind..</p>
